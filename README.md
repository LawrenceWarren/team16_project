# About this branch

Each subdirectory here is a prototype page that one of the group members wrote. 
You may notice there are only 4 subdirectories - 1 of the group members did not 
submit their prototype to the remote, and one of the members prototype branches 
had 1 commit with an empty HTML file.

You may notice that each branch is very different. This is because we hadn't 
really decided what technologies we were going to use, or what style to use, so 
we all just kind of wrote our prototypes as best we could. In short, we didn't 
know what we were doing.

I'm only keeping these directories here for the sake of assessment. To be clear:

- Each subdirectory represents a prototype made by 1 person.
- Each subdirectory is a unique program, originally on it's own branch (I've 
  simply merged the branches into 1 for repo cleanliness)
- **If you are maintaing this repository, you do not need this branch.**
